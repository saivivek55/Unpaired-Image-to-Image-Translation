# Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation

## Project Overview
This project explores unpaired image-to-image translation using the Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation (UNIT) framework. The goal is to transform images from one domain to another without requiring paired examples. The project focuses on two datasets:
- **Monet2Photo:** Translating Monet-style paintings to real photographs.
- **Summer2Winter Yosemite:** Translating summer scenes to winter scenes in Yosemite.

## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the datasets.
- **Model Implementation:** Implemented the UNIT model to perform unpaired image-to-image translation.
- **Results Visualization:** Provided visual comparisons between input and translated images to demonstrate model performance.

## How to Run This Project-
To replicate the analysis:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saivivek55/Unpaired-Image-to-Image-Translation.git
cd Unpaired-Image-to-Image-Translation
# Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed
# Open the Jupyter Notebook 'Pix2Pix & Unit_Image Translation.ipynb' to view the implementation
